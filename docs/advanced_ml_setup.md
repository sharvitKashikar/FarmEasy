# 🚀 Ultra-Advanced ML Libraries Setup

`setup_ultra.py` is a utility script designed to install advanced machine learning libraries that can be used to achieve higher performance in models, potentially for applications like the Sustainable Agriculture Yield Predictor (`app_ultra.py`).

## Installed Packages
This script attempts to install the following packages:
- `xgboost>=1.7.0`
- `lightgbm>=3.3.0`
- `optuna>=3.0.0` (for hyperparameter optimization)
- `catboost>=1.1.0`

## How to Run
1.  **Execute**: Run the script directly from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python not in use/setup_ultra.py
    ```

## Benefits
Installing these libraries enables enhanced features for machine learning models, including:
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Microsoft's Fast Gradient Boosting (LightGBM)
- Stacking Ensemble capabilities
- Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning
- Ultra Feature Engineering

## Notes
- This script is currently located in the `not in use/` directory, suggesting it might be for experimental or advanced setups. Ensure you understand the dependencies and implications before running.
- The success of the installation depends on your system's environment and existing Python setup.
